### Personal Statement
I am a 23 year old graduate of Lincoln university, having recently completed a 3-year degree course in Computer Science with Games Development.  I am looking for ways to learn and expand upon my existing knowledge of game design, whilst having ample opportunities to be creative within a team of similar minded folk.

I have extensive experience in a range of different programming languages, working primarily in C++ and C#, often combined with industry standard game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4. I also have a good deal of experience in scripting languages such as Python, as well as with rendering tools such as GLSL and PhysX. 

I've spent the last year working in Typescript, developing games for Switch Studios in Ipswich.
 
I am a highly motivated, hardworking, and conscientious individual and am willing to perform any tasks that more efficiently solve problems and further my own range of skills.
