### Personal Statement
I am a 21 year old student at Lincoln university currently finishing a 3-year degree course in Computer Science with Games Development from September 2019.  I am looking for ways to learn and expand upon my existing knowledge of game design, whilst having ample opportunities to be creative within a team of similar minded folk.

I have extensive experience in a range of different programming languages, working primarily in C++ and C#, often combined with industry standard game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4. I also have a good deal of experience in scripting languages such as Python, as well as with rendering tools such as GLSL and PhysX. 
 
I am a highly motivated, hardworking, and conscientious individual and am willing to perform any tasks that more efficiently solve problems and further my own range of skills.
